     <p>Deformaties in the eyelids caused from cancer created the need
        for blepharoplasty. This would also be utilized for issues in vision with 
        droopy eyelids.
        </p>
     <p>This desire to help people with injuries changed when there was a 
        want to look youthfull and more "awake". Surgery to improve
        bagginess and puffiness in the eyes triumphed as abled bodied individuals
        began to cosmetic eyelid surgery.
     </p>
        <p>Trends calling for "cat eyes", "siren eyes", and "doe eyes" called for a 
         more angular or change in shape of the natural eye socket. This birthed
        Canthoplasty to elongate to almond-shaped eyes.

        <p> Injuries from athletes or just closed breathing canals called for 
            a surgery to help open these holes and allow for easy breathing.
        </p>
        <p>Rhinoplasty became one of the most common surgeries to undergo
            for nose injuries or breathing issues.
        </p>
        <p>When it came to cosmetics this surgery was very popular due to how popular
            eurocentric nose structure was and how easy the process itself was.
            The procedure took only few hours to undergo, and the healing process
            was as fast as 7-10 days.
        </p>
        <p>Changes desired from this procedure include reduction in size,
            turned up tip and help with symmetry. Many people desired a more button nose
            look instead of a larger bridge that sticks out.
