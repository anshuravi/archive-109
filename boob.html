    <H4>1895</H4>
    <ul>
        <li>Surgeon Vincez Csemy performed the earliest breast augmentation in 1895 by removing a benign lipoma due to
            asymmetry from tumor removal.</li>
        <li>Over the next 50 years, implants were made of different materials including but not limited to ivory, wool,
            rubber, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <H4>1962</H4>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1962, American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow created the very first silicone implant
            beginning the modern era of breast augmentation.</li>
        <li>The implants went through several transformations over the next few decades.</li>
    </ul>
    <H4>1990s</H4>
    <ul>
        <li>Despite the improvements, the FDA banned silicone implants in the early 1990s due to health complication
            concerns. </li>
    </ul>
    <H4>2006</H4>
    <ul>
        <li> Over a decade later in 2006, the FDA deemed saline implants safe and lifted the ban. </li>
    </ul>
    <H4>2010s</H4>
    <ul>
        <li> Ever since then breast implants have been more popular in the United States peaking in the 2010s, with
            celebrities like the Kardashians. </li>
    </ul>

    <H4>2020s</H4>
    <ul>
        <li> As of 2023, the trend of breast implants has seen a decrease with breast reduction reigning in popularity.
        </li>
    </ul>

        Within a decade trends for "boob jobs" have gone from one extreme to another. Who knows what the future has to
        hold?
