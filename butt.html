<h1>Brazilian Butt Lift</h1>
<body>
    <p>In 1969 an individual underwent surgery to add a round
        breast implant to thei glute muscle to help with symmetry due to atrophy.

    <H4>1980s-2000s</H4>
    <p>Before the 2000s there was a strong desire for an athletic
        build for women, and this was included in the glute area. Many
        women were encouraged to do squts to get a more firm appearing rear
        and this was reflected in the style of BBL surgeries.
    </p>
    <H4>2000s-2020s</H4>
<p>The 2000s brought a big jump in the desire for huge BBLs and a lot
    of this trend can be attributed to celebrities getting surgeries to have a 
    larger rear. One infamous celebrity for this is Ki Kardashian, whose trend went
    as far to push for the redesign of jeans to accomodate these huge backsides.
</p>
<H4>2020-2023</H4>
<p>What will this new era bring for the rise of BBLs? This procedure is extremley dangerous
    and can even lead to death, yet many people have risked their lives and time
    to gain this look. With the pendulum swinging back there is now a desire
    to reverse these over-the-top glutes. There is still a want for large backsides, but not
    as overdone as the previous years.
